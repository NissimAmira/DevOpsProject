Phase 4: Advanced Automation – GitOps & Monitoring
Objective:
Enhance your QuakeWatch deployment by implementing GitOps practices for
continuous deployment and setting up comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus
and Grafana.
Tasks:
● GitOps with ArgoCD:
○ ArgoCD Setup:
■ Install ArgoCD on your Kubernetes (k3s) cluster.
■ Configure ArgoCD to track a Git repository containing your
Kubernetes manifests (or Helm charts) for QuakeWatch.

○ Auto-Sync & Deployment Management:
■ Configure auto-sync policies so that changes in Git are
automatically reflected in your cluster.
■ Implement sync waves and hooks for managing complex
deployment scenarios if needed.

○ Documentation:
■ Provide ArgoCD configuration files and a guide on how to use
ArgoCD to manage your deployments.

● Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana:
○ Prometheus Installation:
■ Deploy Prometheus into your cluster to collect metrics from
QuakeWatch and the cluster itself.
■ Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application and
Kubernetes components.

○ Grafana Setup:
■ Install Grafana and connect it to Prometheus.
■ Create custom dashboards that visualize application metrics (e.g.,
CPU/memory usage, request rates, error rates) and cluster health.

○ Alerting:
■ Configure alerting rules in Prometheus to notify you when critical
issues arise (e.g., high error rates or pod failures).

○ Documentation:
■ Document the Prometheus and Grafana setup along with sample
dashboards and alerting configurations.

Deliverables:
● ArgoCD configuration files and a documented guide for GitOps deployment.
● Prometheus and Grafana configuration manifests (or Helm charts) along with
sample dashboards.
● Documentation on the GitOps and monitoring setup, including screenshots of
dashboards and descriptions of alerting rules.
● Git repository with all the code
